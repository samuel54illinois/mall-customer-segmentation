# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project uses K-means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending behavior. The goal was to identify distinct customer groups and provide actionable business insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Introduction
I chose this project to deepen my understanding of customer segmentation and clustering techniques. It was an exciting opportunity to combine exploratory data analysis and machine learning to derive actionable business insights. Through this project, I learned how to preprocess data, apply the K-means algorithm, and interpret the results for practical applications.

## Key Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations.
- Applied K-means clustering with the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Provided actionable business insights for each customer segment.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

## Results
The clustering process revealed interesting customer behavior:
1. Low-income, low-spending customers.
2. High-income, high-spending customers.
3. Low-income, high-spending customers.
4. High-income, low-spending customers.

One surprising finding was the distinct cluster of low-income but high-spending customers. This highlights the importance of not solely relying on income to predict spending habits, as there might be other influencing factors like lifestyle or preferences.

## What I Learned
- The importance of normalizing data before applying K-means clustering.
- How to use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- The value of effective data visualization for storytelling.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate additional features like age and gender to refine the clustering.
- Compare K-means clustering with other algorithms, such as DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize the results dynamically.
